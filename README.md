#Pipeline project
**3rd project for Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp**
**Project spec: https://github.com/ironhack-datalabs/datamad1020-rev/tree/master/projects/W3-pipelines-project**

* Project description: 
I used data from basketball-reference and scraped hoops-hype website to get player performance data and salaries for all NBA players in the 2018-2019 season and used this with Python in hopes to find which players were giving their respective teams more bang for their buck and which ones were putting General Managers across the league with their poor return of investment (Spoiler alert: giving Chandler Parsons a max contract was not a bright move).
#
* Repo description: 
In this repository you can find the notebooks used to clean, analyse and visualise data in the notebooks folder, graphs in the praphs folder and all the data used in separate and combined csvs can be found in the data folder.
#
* main.py:
When running this program users will be able to query the dataset to find stats for any player or the n leaders for any stat.
#
* Results:
To help present our discoveries I created a presentation on Google Slides which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IT8aTbuES9KD3V7E7jjdwrPdU82nBhBZ7wLgNNXYXWY/edit#slide=id.ga8acce97da_1_44
